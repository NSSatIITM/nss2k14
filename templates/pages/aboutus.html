                The <span class='nss'>NSS of IIT Madras</span> has consciously undergone a series of structural and ideological changes in order to foster creativity and innovation in all its activities. Standing by our motto <span class='bold'>Salvation through Education</span>, we actively promote Projects that are related to the theme of education, though we will support any project related to helping others.
                <br /><br />
                By working out projects from Braille magazines to technology interventions, from teaching children in urban slums to educational video content, <span class='nss'>NSS (IITM)</span> seeks to challenge the mediocre thinking, and reach out into the darkness, to pull a hand into the light.

                The <span class='nss'>National Service Scheme of IIT Madras</span> was initiated over four decades ago with a vision, a sincere vision to cause benefit to the society, creating in due course a country with equality in thought and opportunity.
                <br /><br />
                We at <span class='nss'>NSS</span> function with a mission to mobilise our nation’s youth into a sect of progressive citizens and imbibe in them an inclination towards social service. As we battle corruption, greed, hunger, poverty, and illiteracy, we hope that one day our country will once again be restored the title of the Golden Bird. To this brilliant future, we commit.
